Due to the large file size of the full data model (.pbix), the raw file and high-resolution PDF report are available upon request. This README serves as a summary of the analytical findings. 

Due to the upload size limit of the pbix file (>500MB) on Github Web, the file is accesible for download through onedrive: https://mcgill-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/jingjun_yu_mail_mcgill_ca/Documents/Fintech%20fraud/fraud%20analysis_Julia%20Yu.pbix?csf=1&web=1&e=5mlxdh
